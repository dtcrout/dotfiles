# Void Linux dotfiles

These dotfiles are specific to my Void Linux + dwm setup.

* `.Xmodmap`: This remaps Caps Lock to Ctrl
* `.xinitrc`: What to run when starting X. This includes things like
  * key bindings
  * wallpaper
  * transparency
  * window manager
* `20-intel.conf`: Fixes screen tearing for Intel graphics
